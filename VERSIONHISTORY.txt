SimpleShell Version History

================================================================================
Stage One

Commenced 	- 28/01/2014
Ended		- 04/02/2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	v0.0 - 28/01/2014 - File birth

		Created initial file (SimpleShell.c) as well as read me files and a
		github repo.
		^ Tom

	v0.0.1 - 01/02/2014 - User input

		Created a basic loop to prompt the user and taken input using 
		fgets(). This is then checked to ensure that the user has not
		just hit enter. Once we are sure we have a sensible input, it is
		tokenised and printed back out the console. The user can also  
		exit the program if he desires. 
		^ Tom

		The command shall be stored in a struct, as this can be easily 
		accessed and passed, although this has not yet been fully
		implemented yet. 
		^ Tom

	v0.0.2 - 01/02/2014 - Reorganized 

		Mover the prompting of the user; getting input and tokenizing it to 
		a new function: getInput(). 
		^ Aidan

	v0.0.3 - 02/02/2014 - Loop improvement

		Changed while loop to a do while loop. Removes the need for an if check
		in main for when an INPUT_EXIT is returned. While check now replaces it.
		^ Grant

	v0.0.4 - 04/02/2014 - Ctrl D Integration

		Completed integration of Ctrl D to end the program by adding an if
		check on the input the check if fgets() returns NULL indicating the
		presence of the EOF signal. 
		^ Grant/Thomas

	v0.0.5 - 04/02/2014 - Clean up

		Cleaned up loose ends in the code:
			- checked the number of the parameters does not exceed the size of 
			the array
			- added comments for clarity
			- added whitespace
			- removed excess braces
			- reverted back to old user loop. As it will be more efficient once
			new features are added.
		
		This should be the final version of stage 1, apart from a brief 
		modification after testing to remove input checking printf()'s
		^ Tom

	v0.0.6 - 06/02/2014

		Fixed spelling issues
		^ Tom

	v0.1.0 - 14/02/2014 - Final stage one

 		Finalized everything.
 		^ Tom

Stage Two

Commenced 	- 07/02/2014
Ended		- 14/02/2014 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	v0.1.1 - 07/02/2014 - Input Processing
 
		Created a new function, called processInput(), to process the user Input 
		and run an executable file stored on the user's computer using the 
		fork(), waitpid() & execv()functions. The program can currently execute
		executable files within the current directory and it's subdirectories. 
		^ Thomas
 
 	v0.1.2 - 07/02/2014 - Further Input Processing
 
 		Changed execv() to execvp() to allow the SimpleShell to execute commands
 		from the PATH environment. Any programs stored locally can be ran with 
 		" ./ ". Also added more commentary throughout the program to explain
 		what it is doing.
		^ Thomas
 
 	v0.1.3 - 11/02/2014 - Fixed C99 Warnings
 
 		Added " #include <unistd.h> " to remove warnings from C99 when compiling.
		^ Thomas
 
 	v0.1.4 - 11/02/2014 - Invalid Input Filtering
 
 		Enclosed execvp() in an if statement so that when it returns "-1" indicating
 		that it has failed due to invalid input being entered, the child process
		is killed allowing the parent to continue therefore stopping "Shellception".
		^ Thomas

 	v0.1.5 - 11/02/2014 - Passing Input to Commands
 
 		Set execvp() to take process the arguments stored in command.args. To do
 		this, args[50][50] within the user_command struct had to be changed to
 		args[50] as execvp() could not handle the data type. I am now using
 		malloc within processInput() to assign each token it's space in memory.
		We also have to work out where and how to free any memory assigned by
 		malloc in order avoid any problems with memory in out systems.
 		<stdlib.h> was included to allow malloc to be used.
 
 		I also had to make another change within the processInput() function
 		as the command must be stored in args[0] with the arguments stored in
 		args[1] and onwards when it is passed into execp(). This has to be tidied
 		up as input_command is still being used in some places when it could probably
 		be completely removed.
 
 		The SimpleShell can now successfully carry out most built in unix commands
 		and run executable files. It can also pass in any required parameters.
		^ Thomas
 
 	v0.1.6 - 12/02/2014 - Memory Freeing
 
 		Created the function freeMemory() to free memory from malloc after each 
		command has been executed. It will clear all memory used by the malloc 
		for the args array from position 0 to the last used position.
		^ Thomas

	v0.1.7 - 13/02/2014 - Remove user_command
 
 		The user_command has been found to be redundant and unnecessary. The 
 		variable char *args[50] has been used to replace the original struct,
		user_command. The command will be stored in args[0] with the parameters 
		proceeding it in the following locations in the array. The entire 
		program has been adjusted to reflect these changes, with function 
		headers which take in a command as a parameter being altered 
		accordingly.
		^ Aidan

	v0.1.8 - 13/02/2014 - Fixing Aidan's Errors

 		Discovered that Aidan's changes contained a few bugs which I went through and
 		fixed. There were problems relating running commands as the command was stored
		in command[0] then malloc was being used to assign the memory. The line 
		assigning memory had simply been overlooked when making changes. Also added a 
		new function to reset command to NULL everytime the program continues the
		loop.
 		^ Thomas

		Cleaned up getInput() to make it more readable and maintainable. 
		Also removed all input checking printf's as the function now works correctly.
 		^ Tom
 
 		Fixed issue with kill() not being defined in linux.
 		^ Tom
 
 		Removed all input checking "printf's" & "puts" from processInput().
 		^ Thomas
 
 	v0.1.9 - 14/02/2014 - Improving malloc()
 
 		Improved malloc() in getInput() function to only assign the amount of
		memory that it needs rather than a fixed amount. This will stop the
 		program assigning too much memory for a value therefore leaving wasted
 		space or not assigning enough memory and causing a segmentation error
 		at runtime.
 		^ Thomas

 	v0.2.0 - 14/02/2014 - Final stage two

 		Finalized everything.
 		^ Tom

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	v0.2.1 - 14/02/2014 - Set Home Directory
 
 		Created a function which changes the current directory to the home
 		directory by first using getenv() to get the location of the home directory
 		then chdir to move into it. The function is called as soon as the program
 		runs.
 		^ Thomas

 	v0.3.0 - 14/02/2014 - Final stage two

 		Finalized everything.
