 /******************************************************************************
 * Synopsis: This is a simple Unix like shell written in C, for the class CS210 
 *      at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. This was a group project to be 
 *      undertaken by four students.
 *
 * Compiling: This program should be compiled using the C99 standard. This is
 *      due to the inclusion of c++ style comments i.e: //comment
 *      The flag for this is: -std=c99
 *
 * Bugs:
 *      For past bugs please see Revision History

 * 
 *	For detailed Version history please see "VERSIONHISTORY.txt"
 *
 *
 * 	v0.0 - 28/01/2014 - File birth
 *
 * 		Created initial file (SimpleShell.c) as well as read me files and a
 * 		github repo.
 *
 * 	v0.1 - 01/02/2014 - Stage One
 *
 *		Created the user loop, which gets input from the user. The input is
 *		check to make sure it is not absolute gibberish and tokenized. The
 *		result is stored in a structure called user_command.
 *
 *	v0.1.1 - 07/02/2014 - Input Processing
 *
 *		Created a new function to process the user Input and run an executable
 *		file stored on the user's computer using the fork(), waitpid() & execv()
 *		functions. The program can currently execute executable files within 
 *		the current directory and it's subdirectories. See issues for bugs.
 *		
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.2 - 07/02/2014 - Further Input Processing
 *
 *		Changed execv() to execvp() to allow the SimpleShell to exectute commands
 *		from the PATH enviroment. Any programs stored locally can be ran with 
 *		" ./ ". Also added more commentary throughout the program to explain
 *		what it is doing.
 *
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.3 - 11/02/2014 - Fixed C99 Warnings
 *
 *		Added " #include <unistd.h> " to remove warnings from C99 when compiling.
 *
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.4 - 11/02/2014 - Invalid Input Filtering
 *
 *		Enclosed execvp() in an if statement so that when it returns "-1" indicating
 *		that it has failed due to invalid input being entered, the child process
 *		is killed allowing the parent to continue therefore stopping "Shellception".
 *
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.5 - 11/02/2014 - Passing Input to Commands
 *
 *		Set execvp() to take process the arguments stored in command.args. To do
 *		this, args[50][50] within the user_command struct had to be changed to
 *		args[50] as execvp() could not handle the data type. I am now using
 *		malloc within processInput() to assign each token it's space in memory.
 *		We also have to work out where and how to free any memory assigned by
 *		malloc in order avoid any problems with memory in out systems.
 *		<stdlib.h> was included to allow malloc to be used.
 *
 *		I also had to make another change within the processInput() function
 *		as the command must be stored in args[0] with the arguments stored in
 *		args[1] and onwards when it is passed into execp(). This has to be tidied
 *		up as input_command is still being used in some places when it could probably
 *		be completely removed.
 *
 *		The SimpleShell can now successfully carry out most built in unix commands
 *		and run executable files. It can also pass in any required parameters.
 *
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.6 - 12/02/2014 - Memory Freeing
 *
 *		Added a function to free memory from malloc after each command has been
 *		executed.		
 *
 *		- Thomas
 *
 *	v0.1.7 - 13/02/2014 - Remove user_command
 *
 *		The user_command has been found to be redundant and unneccesary. The 
 *		variable char *args[50] has been used to replace the struct. The command
 *		will be in args[0] with the parameters proceeding it. The entire program
 *		has been gutted to reflect these changes, with function headers which
 *		take in a command as a parameter being altered and such.
 *
 *		- Aidan
